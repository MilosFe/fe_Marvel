#Workflow description

Project is created with my modifed version of create react app for fast prototyping. 
React framework was chosen over Angular becuse of simplicity UI and. 

Custom grid created is similar to bootstrap grid, nameing convention is kept beacuse it's awsome.
BEM is chosen for methodology and SCSS/SASS/SMACCS for css and it's architecture.

Firstly i created layout and templates that will be later on turned to components, it's easier for me and
my style of prototyping apps. Then i deicded i will use REDUX for this application.

I had couple of ways croping image for earlier and later browsers but i chose this one beacuse task stated it should work 
on all modern browsers so legacy support was not needed.

Rest of the application is simply done on component mount i check if there is local.storage item and i display them. I made components for 
Search, List, And Avanger (seperation of concerns)






#Troubles in task
I spent some time working on redux part and lost the track of time so i didnt finish bookmark part all tough i had idea for that one 
looping over storage items and adding class which is preaperd in css. My apologys for that i hope that wont affect your overall impresion of my work.
